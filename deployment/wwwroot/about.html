      <p>The <strong>CoralMap</strong> is a website for map-based access to spatial data from Australian previous census and predictions to the future immigration patterns of Australia.
      It is a capstone project as part of the Master Degree in Information Technology specialised in Articial Intelligence at The University of Melbourne .</p>

 

      <p>The <strong>CoralMap</strong> is a fully open architecture that is based on TerriaMap and TerriaJS. When you access data through it, which has been transformed and processed from its original source

         <li>provides easy access to country of origin data at the Local Government Area from census 2006</li>
         <li>Makes predictions about the country of origin for census 2021 with a high degree of precision</li>
         <li>Predictions are made with machine learning algorithms using various data inputs such as income, job, industry, religion and cultural background</li>

      <p>The NationalMap is Open Source software available as a
      <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap" target="_blank">Github project</a>. The core platform, <a href="https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs" target="_blank">TerriaJS</a>, was initially
      developed by Data61 for the NationalMap, but has subsequently been used for other projects. It has been made available
      to assist with the development of other spatial data viewing applications.</p>


      <h2>Additional Open Source Software Used</h2>

      <p>In developing the NationalMap, Data61 has used open source software and contributed back to it.  NationalMap leverages these
      excellent open source libraries:</p>

        <li><a href="http://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap/blob/master/LICENSE.md">complete list</a> is available with the <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap">NationalMap source code</a></p>
